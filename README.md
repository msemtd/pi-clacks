# pi-clacks

Raspberry Pi with camera used to visually interpret Clacks arrays.

In brief,
* calibrate camera
* capture shots and...
* scan for 3x3 clacks array - borders may be necessary
* pass info to comms stage
* drive own clacks array to respond - half or full duplex
** serial commands to arduino only?
